          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-emerald-700 mb-4">What is Robots.txt and Why You Need It</h2>
          <div className="prose max-w-none text-gray-700 space-y-4">
            <p>
              A <strong>robots.txt file</strong> is a simple text file that tells search engine crawlers which pages or sections of your website they can and cannot access. Think of it as a bouncer at a club - it controls who gets in and what areas they can visit. Every website should have one, and creating it doesn't have to be complicated.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-emerald-600 mt-6 mb-3">How Does Robots.txt Work?</h3>
            <p>
              When search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo visit your website, the first thing they look for is the <strong>robots.txt file</strong> at your root domain (like https://example.com/robots.txt). This file gives them instructions about what they should and shouldn't crawl. If certain pages are marked as "Disallow," well-behaved bots will skip those pages entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's the thing though - robots.txt is more like a suggestion than a law. Good bots (like Googlebot) respect it, but malicious bots might ignore it completely. So don't use robots.txt for security - it's purely for SEO and crawl budget management.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-emerald-600 mt-6 mb-3">Common Use Cases for Robots.txt</h3>
            <p>
              You'll want to use a <strong>robots.txt generator</strong> to block certain areas of your site from being indexed. Typical examples include admin panels (/admin/), API endpoints (/api/), login pages, duplicate content, or staging environments. You might also want to prevent crawlers from accessing image or CSS files to save bandwidth, though this is less common nowadays.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another critical use is including your <strong>sitemap URL</strong> in robots.txt. This tells search engines exactly where to find the master list of all your important pages, making it easier for them to discover and index your content efficiently.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-emerald-600 mt-6 mb-3">Best Practices for Creating Robots.txt</h3>
            <p>
              Keep it simple. Start with "User-agent: *" which targets all bots, then use "Allow: /" to permit crawling by default. Add specific "Disallow" directives only for paths you genuinely don't want indexed. Always include your sitemap URL at the bottom - this is crucial for SEO.
            </p>
            <p>
              Avoid blocking important resources like CSS and JavaScript files unless you have a specific reason. Google needs to see these to properly render and understand your pages. Also, don't use robots.txt to hide sensitive information - use proper authentication and password protection instead.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-emerald-600 mt-6 mb-3">Testing Your Robots.txt File</h3>
            <p>
              After you create and upload your <strong>robots.txt file</strong>, test it using Google Search Console's robots.txt Tester tool. This shows you exactly how Googlebot interprets your directives and helps catch any mistakes before they impact your SEO. Common errors include accidentally blocking your entire site or using the wrong syntax.
