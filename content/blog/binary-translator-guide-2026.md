### What is a Binary Translator?

A binary translator is a tool or software that converts binary code (a series of 0s and 1s) into human-readable text, ASCII, or other formats. Binary code is the fundamental language of computers, representing data and instructions using only two symbols: 0 and 1. Translating binary code is essential for decoding messages, debugging, and learning about computer science.

### How Does a Binary Translator Work?

A binary translator works by taking a string of binary numbers and converting them into their corresponding characters. Each group of eight binary digits (bits) represents a single character in the ASCII table. For example, the binary code `01001000` translates to the letter “H”.

#### Example:
- Binary: `01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111`
- Text: “Hello”

### Binary to ASCII and English: Explained

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard. Each character is assigned a unique binary value. A binary translator decodes these values, making it possible to read binary messages in English or any other language supported by ASCII.

#### Example Table:

| Binary     | ASCII | Character |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 01000001   | 65    | A         |
| 01100010   | 98    | b         |
| 00110011   | 51    | 3         |
